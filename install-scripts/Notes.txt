Strategy for Events
- When a nonAdin user logs in, they have to select the event for which they want to register their runners for.
  They can only login if the event's regisration status is in the Open state. 
- Admin users also select an event, for consistency, and because I don't know who's logging in when the menu 
  is being formed, but because it's possible for no events to be populated in the system (fresh install), I have to
  allow no Event to be selected, but only for Admin users.
